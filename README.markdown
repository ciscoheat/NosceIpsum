## Nosce Ipsum

"Nosce te Ipsum", or [Know Thyself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself), is an ancient Greek aphorism that 
encourages introspection and deepening the knowledge about the self. Many philosophers and original teachers of 
religions (Buddha, Jesus) regards this to be extremely important for spiritual development. 

In modern times, [Eckhart Tolle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle) is one of the foremost spokesmen of 
this concept with his book [The Power of Now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Now). This application is 
a helpful tool for those who wants to be reminded in a gentle way to keep focus on the Now. 

### Functionality

Within a specified interval, a little popup window will fade in randomly on screen with a short reminder, and
fade away after a few seconds. All intervals and the reminders can be configured.

### Technology

It is a simple WPF application written in C# for .NET 3.5. Resource files are used to provide multi-language
support.
